# Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML

This course is part of the Coursera Practical Data Science Specialization.

This course teaches foundational concepts for exploratory data analysis (EDA), automated machine learning (AutoML), and text classification algorithms. 

* Use Amazon SageMaker Clarify and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to analyze a dataset for statistical bias, transform the dataset into machine-readable features, and select the most important features to train a multi-class text classifier. 

* Perform automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically train, tune, and deploy the best text-classification algorithm for the given dataset using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot.

* Work with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText, a highly optimized and scalable implementation of the popular FastText algorithm, to train a text classifier with very little code.
