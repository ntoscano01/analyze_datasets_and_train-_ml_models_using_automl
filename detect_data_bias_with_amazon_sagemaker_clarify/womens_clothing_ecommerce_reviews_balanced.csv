-1,The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,Blouses
-1,This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for,Blouses
-1,"I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27"" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m",Blouses
-1,This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!,Blouses
-1,Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2  130 lbs  34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately  i will be returning.,Blouses
-1,Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty,Blouses
-1,I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n,Blouses
-1,The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.,Blouses
-1,I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer,Blouses
0,I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.,Blouses
0,I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!,Blouses
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo,Blouses
0,True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!,Blouses

0,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.,Blouses
0,"The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7""  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch""  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung",Blouses
0,Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist  this won't fit well. too bad  because it's super cute  if a bit sheer.,Blouses
0,"This shirt is enormous and  as the title of my review suggests  it looks like a men's button down. the fabric is quite sheer  but that's actually what i liked best about it. i just looked completely shapeless in this top & wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it. perhaps if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i might have liked it better - it didn't fit anything like the model photos suggest - it's huge. not ""easy/slouchy"".",Blouses

1,"I've been coveting the first edition of this top (pineapples) and was thrilled to find this same style with lemons. i called my local store and put a few sizes on hold so i could ensure the perfect fit. good job i did! the top is beautiful but it's super tight across the back - fine if you want to stand still & look pretty. if  however  you want to go about your usual activities  like eat for example  i'd suggest you size up. for reference i'm usually a 2-4 in retailer tops (34b  5' 5"" and 130lbs)",Blouses
1,Perfect lace tank. i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model. i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts . it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust. it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed. so beautiful!,Blouses
1,Very feminine! comes with a coordinating cami. i liked it so much that i'm going to order the other color  too!,Blouses
1,Saw this online  but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on  but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it  which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small  but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same  with maybe a tad mo,Blouses
1,Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely  not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.,Blouses
1,I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top  faded  ripped  rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.,Blouses
1,...but it does have it's problems. the neck  although it has pretty button detail at the back  is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat  necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliquã©d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the,Blouses
-1,I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...,Dresses
-1,This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.,Dresses
-1,I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.,Dresses
-1,The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.,Dresses
-1,"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",Dresses
-1,I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this,Dresses
-1,"Like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well  i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo  although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms)  and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small  which is what",Dresses
-1,"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.",Dresses
-1,I drooled over this dress online  so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person  & the drape of the skirt (good quality  fully lines)  i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight  ill-fitting  & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size. it's a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable!,Dresses
0,I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say  i won't be keeping the dress. the layers  fabric  and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.,Dresses
0,I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite  added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!,Dresses
0,Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures  and it has a lovely quality in person  the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on  and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips  large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.,Dresses
0,So  i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms  armpit  thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length  but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and,Dresses

0,I wanted to love this dress  especially because it's been given good reviews. i ordered the blue and tried it on. the fit was pretty good and the color is pretty and deep. i did not like the seam that ran around the drop waist. it created a weird allusion that the two pockets in front was actually a continuous pouch around the dress. i also did not like the neckline - there is fabric added on the shoulders that's in a different fabric and makes it look like you're wearing a t-shirt underneath th,Dresses
0,"The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on  i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise.",Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side  across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser  i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.,Dresses
0,I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw,Dresses
1,"This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight  nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it.",Dresses

1,"At 5'4"" i typically order petite clothing...i was unsure of this dress/tunic-shirt from the photos online  the reviews and the hi/low hem. i ordered xs and pxs (about 118#). both fit as far as shoulders and through the body but the pxs was way too short on me to wear as a dress without any leggings. the length of the regular xs works great and i feel is appropriate for someone my age! it is buttery soft and so comfortable. i ordered the suede wrap belt to go with it. also  the sleeves are too ti",Dresses

1,I tried this on in the store. all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes (and i love all of my local retailer stores!) i don't think these should be hung on a hanger. the knit is too heavy for hanging. the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor. i went home and ordered it online with the 20% dress discount and free shipping. the dress i received was clean  unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review,Dresses

-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge

-1,A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.,Fine gauge
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

1,This is a very comfortable bralette- the silk covers one's most sensitive parts  so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing. it's very pretty  too. i wear a 34b bra and the small fits me. it doesn't have a lot of support  but it's very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands. the cups are a little far apart  but it still works. if you're looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear  i would recommend this at the sale price.,Intimates
1,I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing  i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather,Intimates
1,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,Intimates
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",Intimates
-1,I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.,Jackets
-1,Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.,Jackets
-1,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.,Jackets
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,Jackets
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",Jackets
-1,I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.,Jackets
-1,This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,Jackets

-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
0,At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.,Jackets

0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
0,Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.,Jackets
0,This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large  i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!,Jackets
1,"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets  but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2""   120 lbs.  but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips  but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled  but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!",Jackets
1,I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.  it runs a little big  so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side  but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.,Jackets
1,I love the soft  slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order  the green version had sold out. as it turns out  the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today  but i wore it anyway!,Jackets
1,"I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops  however  jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small  but there is plenty of room  so might have even worn an xs. anyway  the material is great  is well made  wonderful pocketsi  super comfy  but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6""  36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!",Jackets

1,I'm short  only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment  and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love  that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog,Jackets
1,Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.,Jackets
1,At 46 years old  i still like fun  hip  fashionable items  but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!,Jackets

-1,These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans
-1,I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.,Jeans
-1,These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.,Jeans
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that,Jeans
-1,They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p,Jeans

0,Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,Jeans
0,First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t,Jeans
0,I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.,Jeans

0,My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.,Jeans

0,I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve,Jeans

0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.,Legwear

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear

0,I purchased this  and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green  and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall  unimpressed.,Lounge
0,This is a fantastic sweater--really soft  great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer  and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose)  but when my arms are lifted out to either side  it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one.,Lounge

0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,Lounge

1,1st  this jacket fits true to size. 2nd  the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing)  as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material  so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.    i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility.,Outerwear

-1,I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.,Pants
-1,Do not waste your money on this.  at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.   fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.  still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.,Pants

-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.,Pants
-1,"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!     for reference ( if you decide to try your luck)  i am 5'7""  128# and my normal size s was perfect.",Pants
-1,These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.,Pants
-1,I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.,Pants
-1,I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.,Pants
-1,I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice  but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.,Pants
0,I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.,Pants

1,These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink  rolled in a towel  and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well  these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!,Pants

1,I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.,Pants

-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts

-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts

0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o,Shorts
