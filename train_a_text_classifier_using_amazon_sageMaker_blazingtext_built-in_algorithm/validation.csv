__label__1 "i really like this sweater . i would suggest ordering a size up . i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable . i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent . i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around . it just was so big and had no shape at all . it 's possible i should have sized down to a small but i 'm sending it back ."
__label__0 "very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees . it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees . too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment . there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer . also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way . the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws . i am 5 ' 6 140lb and the small fit tts . will be sending it back"
__label__-1 "i was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read ... and now i know better . the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos . the sleeves however ran small compared to the body . the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso . the body the opposite ... too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure ... no darts no fitted places nothing making it tailored to fit . open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette . buttoned it sprea"

__label__-1 "material is awful . not soft at all . colors are much darker than shows online . it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model . it went back ."
__label__-1 "i know this product description says oversized but that 's an understatement . i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father 's jacket . i do n't even think an xs would have worked . i 'm 5 ' 6 and about 135 pounds for reference . i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it 's just way too big ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did ! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on ! it is very flattering because i am 5 ' 0 usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect ! the material is light definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat ! highly recommend this dress !"
__label__0 "well this top just did not do anything for me - it 's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit . you 'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through . i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event but it was too buttoned-up for my style . i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me . i did n't care for the feel of the fabric either although the lace is nice ."
__label__0 "loved this shirt but it runs pretty big . i 'm normally a sm/med due to bust size ( 34ddd ) and ordered a small based on other reviews . could have gotten an x-small . debating going to exchange . i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale . better quality than some at retailer ."
__label__0 "i tried on the xs petite and liked it but did n't love . the arm holes seemed big you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides . also the material is soft but thin ( see through somewhat ) . the xs petite just seemed big overall i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available . i am 115 lbs 30dd for reference ."

__label__0 "this dress is really beautiful . very well made and high quality fabrics . unfortunately it is cut very narrow . i am between sizes ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small . i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge . if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you ."

__label__1 "i was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews but i love it ! granted i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy ( it 's summer in socal ) but cover up my tummy . the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset -- -so not a real bra but at least something there . i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect ! really happy with this top !"
__label__-1 "what an adorable and frustrating skirt ! i 'm not a large person : 32d-26-36 . and i ordered my normal size small . this is a pull on skirt and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips . in most retailer clothes i 'm either a size 2 or 4 ; i have to agree with the other reviewer . there is no way to put this item on ."
__label__1 "this is a wonderful vest ! i love the lining ! ! keeps you nice and warm ! i love the muted green color ! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest ! !"
__label__-1 "i am so sad i have to return these leggings . they 're adorable -- so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them -- but as other reviewers have pointed out there 's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they 'll fall down ! why sleeping on snow ? whyyyyyyyyyyy ? they 're so great otherwise !"
__label__1 "so many retailer coats have gotten away from me . sold out before i could purchase . i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale . i did not want this the be the one that got away . so glad i did . the colors are beautiful the sweater is really a coat . so it justifies the price . what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes . length of arms was fine on me . i bought a large . i am 5 foot six ."

__label__0 "i was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model ! however when i put the dress on there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton . i ordered the 0p and i am 5 ' 4 110lbs . maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top ."

( i 'm 5 ' 7 ) i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l .. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top . also i like to have the first button open but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey . it 's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"
__label__0 "this dress is stunning no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly . however the fact that this dress has zero stretch ( which is fine if that 's what you 're looking for ) coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on . i 'm normally a 14/16 at retailer and i ordered the 16 just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist"
__label__0 "i bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model 's photos . the neckline was a bit higher than pictured . the material was pretty in person . the problem was the material 's threads were too scratchy . i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it . i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace ."

__label__0 "i really loved the look of this dress online and could n't wait to try it on . based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium following the petite size chart . the dress was the perfect length for my 5 ' 5 frame but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure . i 'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress . the fabric and lining feel great though . i just was n't the right fit for me ."

__label__-1 "this item is huge . i 'm normally a medium sized down to a small still massive . could n't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest . but the sleeves are very wide as is the waist . way too much fabric . i had high hopes for this one but it just does n't work . for reference i love billowy and flowy tops but this was a tent ."

__label__1 "the material and design of this beach dress is so pretty . i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up but it is only the latter . you ca n't see it from the photos ( the model or mine ) but it is very sheer .... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit . whatever you wear ( or do n't ) will be completely visible . so if you are looking for just a lovely unique beach dress this is it ! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility ! i will consider it on sale !"
__label__1 "love this dress . great lightweight fabric bold colors and lined to the knee . the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth but it breaths well so it does n't add extra heat . i found it ran true to size and it 's a good length for tall girls . i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back . looks great on it 's own or dress it up with a statement necklace . there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement . great find ."

__label__1 "i just purchased this top in the store . it is definitely not tunic length as shown here but rather hip length . also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size . but it is adorable ."
__label__-1 "i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed . first the pink was way to sheer for my liking . the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area . then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect . a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit . the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks ."
__label__0 "dress cut was great but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age ."
__label__0 "this is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front . gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking . however if you have shapely hips and back-side this will definitely emphasize that . had to take it back . a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events . however if you 're less endowed in that area it might work well . gives a great shape !"
__label__1 "i bought a size small ( 5 ' 6 & 130lbs ) . it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much . i ended up looking hippy with no butt . the material is nice and it is a nice quality . i just did n't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area ."
__label__1 "i am normally a size medium or small at retailer ( depending on the bust ) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck . it runs very small . unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try . truthfully i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small . for reference i am 5 ' 6 145 lbs 34dd . also the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing . seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said ."
__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__1 "such an adorable top . very flattering despite it 's rather full style . just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large . i normally wear a small sometimes medium . i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large ! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly ."
__label__1 "saw this top online and hoped for the best . my hopes were rewarded ! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also . i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper . have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just did n't fit in anyway . i ordered an xs petite and it was very large . the lacing in the back is completely useless and that 's what i liked about the dress . i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top ( because of chest ) and then lace more tightly near the waist . it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering . beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit ."
__label__1 "gorgeous top/tunic . runs true to size . i paired it with jeans but i love the look of the white pants in the picture . beautiful and flows nicely ."
__label__-1 "i received this dress in the mail yesterday . right away i noticed the coloring was n't quite the same as it appears in the images online . in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted . i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on . i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses . it ran quite large and was way to long for me ( i am 5 ' 4 '' ) . overall between the coloring and sizing this dress was n't a hit for me ."
__label__-1 "i 'm on the shorter ( 5 '' 3 ) side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer . this is a lovely suit but it did n't work at all for me . it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted . the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all . it was very tight and pinched . sadly i returned it ."
__label__1 "i 'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways . it 's a little long in the back because i 'm short but overall i enjoy wearing it . it 's comfortable casual girly and well made . i 'm happy with it ."
__label__1 "i purchased this shirt in blue and i like it . the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - did n't expect that . but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable ."
__label__-1 "i love the color of this dress . it is not flattering even though it should be . the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky . the lace is heavy but the silky panels are n't . so not flattering it 's just odd . and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape . it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly ."
__label__-1 "the fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type . the top half did not fit well ; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful dress . the lace top is stunning ! the fit is true to size and there 's no stretch . i had the same problem as other reviewers ... that darn zipper . it 's so small and gets hung up easily . i could see it eventually failing in the future ."
__label__0 "i have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer and this is not it . like others it 's just so thin and sheer . i live in the south . i do n't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything . this is fine to layer in cooler temps but now in our horrible summers where that 's the last thing i wish to do . - the only plus i can tell you is it 's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin . however"
__label__1 "i bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect . i got the blue color which is more of a brighter blue than a navy . i 'm 6ft and wear a 10 top but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down . the top was definitely long enough and i did n't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had . this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small"

__label__-1 "this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so there 's very little stretch . for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements there 's no way to get this skirt on past the hips ."
__label__0 "they were ok pants but too small . the texture and shape were not what i expected either ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type . it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for . sadly this will be going back . i loved the print and the feel of the material . just not a flattering cut for me ."
__label__0 "i purchased this on sale xxs petite and i 'm glad i did . it 's an adorable sweater but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city ! bummer . i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped . it 's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute . looks really soft and cozy but i would say itchy and cozy !"
__label__-1 "this product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress . it 's pretty bad when it wo n't even zip up on the hanger . such a beautiful dress ; it broke my heart !"
__label__1 "i love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close does n't work a lot outside of that i love it . i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect ."
__label__0 "i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads . it feels so good on though ! you must be super careful with it . i have no idea how the little snags even got there !"
__label__1 "i absolutely adore this dress ! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress . it 's effortless yet still a showstopper . i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me . it 's not too tight in the ribcage yet it is slimming and flattering . not matronly at all ! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look or worn untied for a breezy casual a bit more sexy look . i will be wearing this dress"

__label__0 "loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low . unless you have 30 arms all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
__label__-1 "the fabric is too sheer also looks like sleepwear . just not my thing ."

__label__1 "this skirt is not only cute but really comfy . i really like the materials it 's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way . i 'm 5 ' 2 so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist . love this skirt !"
__label__-1 "i love cotton fabric so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors . i have the dark red/burnt orange color and it is pretty . but i have worn the thing once and today when i put it on again i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt . so disappointed ."

__label__0 "like the idea of this shirt so much . but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible . wishing the under layer really covered as no way i 'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt . might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back ."

__label__1 "great transition into fall . super soft and comfy . great yellow without being too yellow love it ."
__label__-1 "i 've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks . it is already tearing at the seams somehow . the quality of this is very poor ."
__label__1 "i love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress . i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture . i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it . would n't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5 ' 4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste !"
__label__0 "i was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season . i was n't sure what i thought when trying it on but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it . for me the waistline was a bit high and it had a bit of a frumpy feel . i love the floral pattern but overall it just was n't amazing ."
__label__1 "i thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging ' style . i am 5 ' 7 athletic and the small fit perfect ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."
__label__-1 "i love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight . i have never had this problem before . i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5 ' 4 tall and 117 lbs . the length is perfect and i really like the style . if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser . sorry that this did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "i wish this shirt would not have had so much material . it would make a great maternity top ! if you are really thin it might work for you too ."

__label__-1 "ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box . tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist . within minutes of wearing the waist fell down past my hips ... glad i was at home . looks cute but will not stay up ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this top ! i 've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top something that 'd be ideal for summertime . this beautiful piece does n't disappoint . the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning . not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have . highly recommend ."

__label__0 "this pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin . i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool does n't bother me too much . i 'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress even with the slip which does n't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off . i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea"

__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewers ; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way . the rest of it was beautiful though . looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink . did not look at good as the beige ."
__label__-1 "do not buy ! i used my 15 % discount on this . what a waste . my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand . i should have gotten a small . i do n't think that would 've helped . it was so awkward looking . nothing like the model . it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds . it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet . the material was really thick . it is more appropriate for fall . i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down . it was just so ridiculous ."
__label__1 "the most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on ."
__label__-1 "i loved this shirt ! flattering and pretty . it 's hand wash only or dry clean . i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me . would not recommend due to shrinkage ... too bad ."
__label__0 "i ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large . i am 5 ' 2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5 ' 9 like the model to wear this dress . such a shame .."
__label__-1 "ordered online and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo does n't show how incredibly wide the cut is . it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5 ' 9 130. the embroidery is lovely but the style does n't work . i had a small but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height . might work better on someone with a more petite frame but i do caution how voluminous the cut"
__label__0 "the button detail on the sides is a unique design detail . i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides . but i decided against purchasing this top it appeared shapeless on me . i have a curvier/athletic figure and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure ."

__label__-1 "maybe i should n't have sized up to an xl but i 'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit . the vee is quite low and i 'm busty . it 'll be really low if you 're smaller on top . the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me . not tight at all . it 's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple . i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i would n't recommend it ."
__label__-1 "extremely disappointed with this top . it runs extremely large . i 'm 5 ' 2 130 lbs 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer . i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me . the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all . fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft . unfortunately i will be returning ."
__label__-1 "totally see through ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other review . the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made . the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality ; however the shirt is very wide . i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big . the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance ."
__label__1 "i initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color size l ( my usual size i 'm 5 ' 8 size 14 ) . unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy but loved the pattern and style . so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better . i 'm very happy with my purchase ."
__label__1 "cute staple in classic style overall . fabric weight is good will be able to get by with nude bra . many wardrobe options with this staple ."
__label__0 "the material was a little itchy in my opinion . the fit was pretty big . almost a night shirt . i 'm 5 ' 3 and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights . i got a small . i purchased the orange color online . stay away if you have an olive skin tone ! it 's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website . i 'm 130 pounds 34d"
__label__-1 "the cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible . i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust . after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it . i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces . this did n't hold up to one wearing let alone one season . i recommend strongly against it ."
__label__-1 "i really like this dress/shirt . it 's great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year 's pregnancy weight gain . i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots . unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size . this may sound weird but i 've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward did n't change between the two sizes . i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back ."
__label__0 "i was excited to receive this top because i love the design but was very disappointed when it arrived . i thought the embroidery would be striking but it 's not . the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment . it was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "i had been eyeing this top for weeks . it 's look so beautiful on the model however not great on me . material is fab . the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material ."
__label__-1 "great color soft fabric but waaaaay too long . more like a night shirt than a t-shirt ."
__label__-1 "comments . the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve . and the quality is there with the lining . trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape . imo you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank . i looked at the model ( after purchasing ) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not it is terribly unflattering ."
__label__1 "i fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it . unfort they were out of the s so i went with a medium . fortunately for me this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large i will still keep it . the material is sturdy and of good quality the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy . great piece !"
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__0 "a nice comfy sweatshirt . i do wish it was just a tad longer ; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i 'm only 5 ' 3 ! ( i purchased the regular size not the petite ) also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside ."
__label__0 "this is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details . but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust ( 38d ) even in a larger size than i normally wear . it is also very very short in the body . i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though ."
__label__-1 "this top is absolutely beautiful . the fabric is great the cut is nice etc ... however the buttons are too big for the button loops which do not have any stretch . it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on . once i had it on i left it unbuttoned . i returned it . ( if you ca n't live without it you could put smaller buttons on it . ) too pricey for a non-functioning top . too bad ."
__label__-1 "i love the fit of these pants -- they 're the perfect slim black pants . however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places . disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and do n't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do . i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product ."
__label__-1 "i tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ... until i read dry clean only ! ! ! really retailer ? i know you can do better than that ..."
__label__-1 "i opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on . the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees . someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them . they were obviously too small for whoever did that . these never should have been resent to another customer . they are obviously very misshapen . they are going back . on a bet"
__label__0 "i ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge ."
__label__1 "i was so excited to see these pants on sale . they fit beautifully and drape well . the hidden lining of 'shorts ' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these . now if i could only get them in plain black too ...."
__label__0 "this top would be great if it were longer and the neck was n't so open . even for a boatneck the neck was too wide . for those that do n't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay . the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me ."
__label__0 "recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling"
__label__1 "i saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it . it looked beautiful on top . the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail . sadly the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant . i weigh 111lbs . i am petite and small boned . i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me . i wish i could look good in this ! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture ."
__label__1 "this shirt looked so perfect on the model and i was so excited to get it ! when i received it it was so soft and the color was so vibrant . the only thing is it 's too big . it kind of looks like a maternity shirt . it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me but i 'm happy with it other than that . i 'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy . if they were longer or shorter this would be a win . nice fabric not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips ."
__label__1 "love these . wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots . nice subtle print . i think they run about 1 size small . i 'm normally a size 0/25 . the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled . size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough . incidentally i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too . love love"
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__0 "great color and quality but very boxy . even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here ."
__label__0 "ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online . runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric . i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol . i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on . the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though ! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering !"
__label__0 "i had high hopes after reading all of the reviews but as you can see the dress did n't live up to them . i ordered a size 8 and maybe a 6 would 've fit better but i 'm not going to find out . the sheer area on the model really stands out ; it does not in real life . there were loose threads throughout and there really should n't be at this price point . i was going to wear this to a wedding but as a member of the wedding party i do n't think it would picture well at all . i 'm sorry that it 's headed"
__label__0 "this is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house . i 'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it 's a bit scratchy around the edges . i was going to buy another color if i loved this but as it is i will keep the one"
__label__0 "gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be . in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade . i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends . i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for ."
__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__0 "i am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l . it 's very large ! i normally take a large in retailer but i ca n't figure out my size in this . it 's very wide . i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is ."
__label__1 "love this top ! i 've worn it once and received several compliments . i 'm 5 ' 7 127 and the small fit well . i 'm happy with my purchase ."
__label__-1 "i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all . a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small . for me it 's not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short ( rather than 20 as it states on the website it 's more like 18 ) which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person ! i do n't even want to go regular size because it would 've been too big . i saw some photos that others po"

__label__0 "i love this dress but it is too short to keep . i am 5 ' 8 and weigh 124lbs . most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer . it looks adorable on but it is just too short ( about 3 inches above my knees ) to be considered professional enough to wear to work ."
__label__-1 "i am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss . it is too boxy ( short ) and the material is very thin for the price . i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer . for reference i am 5 ' 4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small . bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 4 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie . i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you 're 5 ' 8 and above ? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm body and skirt . a belt was no match for that much fabric . the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made but the design was awful ."
__label__-1 "this jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif . however it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store . this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time . it 's a big shame because it 's so perfect in every other way . i choose not to buy it . it 's very expensive for the quality ."
__label__0 "i adore a good vest so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately . i do n't wear cream often but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy . i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence . so i bought it took it home and tried it on with everything . i am a curvy girl and i was n't thrilled with how this fit . now its part of the retailer athleisure line and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear . girls who are tall and thin or even w"
__label__0 "i ordered this dress and have sent it back . i think it could be a flattering dress ; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly . i am very long waisted so this might just be a problem for me . i ordered regular size 2 ."
__label__1 "so super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress"
__label__0 "you guys i love this so much ! however within one hour of wearing it the back seam completely ripped . it fit me perfectly ... sadly i & # 39 ; ll have to return the damaged item . really sad it & # 39 ; s all sold out too !"

__label__1 "i bought three -- in part because they were on sale . i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though . they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less . that said they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now . i am typically a small and bought x-small . the drape is not that different in the two sizes but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size . all-i"

__label__1 "this top is very cute . but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it . that is annoying ."
__label__-1 "this top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work . i originally got the size a would normally wear ( a 6 ) .and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem . i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips . i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit"
__label__-1 "when i tried it on it was a bit shapeless but it was on a promo so i decided to get it . i kind off like shapeless . i 've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended ( in a lingerie bag always ) and air dried it . it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam and i can not see how this happened . the inner lining is soft and substantial but the outer gauze layer is thin ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me . it also clings tightly to the body . i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders ."
__label__1 "great very flattering bohemian dress ! and it 's silk !"

__label__0 "this top is really beautiful . the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch . and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big . i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i 'd been able to snag a smaller size . but the m/l looked like a teal sack so it 's going back ."

__label__0 "this dress was so lovely in person but when i put it on ... ooh la la ! it is short ! i am 5 ' 3 and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath . it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure . too bad !"

__label__0 "these are beautiful pants especially when you walk they are simply beautiful and flow nicely . however they are soooo very long ( i am 5 5 1/2 ) and even with a big wedge 's i would have to get these altered . the waist seemed very small i am a sz 12 ( 10 in some stores ) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all . . probably a sz 10 at most . so unfortunetly they have to go back ."
__label__1 "this blouse is pretty sheer but perfect for a summer day . good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure and a very cute opening in on the lower back ."

__label__-1 "c'mon . the accent is wrong ! a simple google search would prevent this ."
__label__-1 "i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest . i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering . i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it . i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown . if there were just less fabric i wo"
__label__1 "this top is beautiful and special . the burnout velvet ( so nice and soft ) the flowers the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful . i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top ( hip area ) than i was expecting but not snug . i will wear this during the holidays and beyond ! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it !"
__label__1 "i am so in love with this top . can be worn on or off the shoulders . the color is amazing !"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt ! the colors are gorgeous very vibrant and just as shown . the fit was all wrong on me . i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy . and it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck . it looked like a sack on me . for reference- i am 5 ' 2 112lbs ... with a small frame ."

__label__0 "i bought this tank for work but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo . i usually wear a xxs or xs ( i am 100 lbs 5 ' 1 ) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose which i wanted . the arm holes were down to my waist and it was also unusually wide . the quality of the fabric is nice though not to heavy and not too thin ."
__label__1 "as always these pilcro pants did not disappoint . i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant . i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model . there is no crotch hang like in the photo . i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming ."
__label__-1 "it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion . i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly ... this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women 's apparel sizing . i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small"
__label__0 "very orange . the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone 's anatomy ... shorter in front and i have a short torso . the fabric is nice and lightweight ."
__label__0 "this dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years . unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others . the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women . while the fabric is beautiful overall the dress did not look like much . disappointed ."
__label__0 "i found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style ? it fits like a sack big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem . it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape . genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style . to bad i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall so i bought it a size smaller than normal but it fits so i could say it runs a little big . very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture ! i 'm more top heavy and it kind of camouflaged that which is always great !"
__label__0 "the outer layer runs large up top ; also the orange stitching ( the flowers ) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath . i 'm returning it because for the price i do n't love it ."
__label__1 "the cut and design of this dress is lovely ! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again . it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses . i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top ( i 'm a 34 dd ) however i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust . also the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit"
__label__0 "this model looks like a bauble head . she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers . this last catalog 's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking . i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit but it 's too small for 34dd . i am tall athletic and have breasts . i think of my shape as average - and the top did n't fit . it 's cut narrow and small ."
__label__1 "very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments . they do fall open when you sit down though they have liner shorts inside for coverage . they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite ."
__label__0 "just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress ! you ca n't tell from the pictures . i ordered thinking it was a dress but it 's actually ... culottes ? i 'm not sure what you would call it . the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky . it definitely goes back !"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this dress . the color is perfect the design and cut are cut ( not always the case at retailer ) . however the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace . it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back ."
__label__-1 "detailed beading was beautiful . it 's too boxy way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips . it does n't fall boxy/boyfriend like . the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture . was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed ."
__label__1 "this is a great light free flowing top for the summer . i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area but if you are small busted you wo n't be affected . it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer !"
__label__0 "i was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit . i am 138 lbs 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit . the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them . also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes . not unpleasant but not as pictured . as"
__label__0 "i wanted to love these but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind . the fabric is so soft however and the color is great . would work on a less curvy woman !"
__label__0 "lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap . this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection . i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years . now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i 'm wearing an orange sack . i 'm not pleased ."
__label__1 "simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it 's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots . very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways . i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i 'm sure the regular would 've been fine . looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram ."
__label__0 "so this is a gorgeous dress but it seems to have too many elements . i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more girly than sleek . i am short so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me ."
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"
__label__-1 "this hoodie was too thin . you can see right through it . i returned it ."
__label__0 "it is a proper fitting oversized shirt . however it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt . i returned it because i do n't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim and these crops were made specifically for petites . also i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean not a skinny . the fit and sizing seems to be a little off . i ordered my regular size in this brand 27p but they were too big . sized down to a 26p . they were still too large in the waist ( seemed very stretchy ) but fit well in the legs . i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top . i really did . the color is beautiful the embroidery is well done the fabric is soft and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat . but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good . i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top . i think i will try again and order next size down ."
__label__1 "this shirt is nothing like the online pictures . it 's a stunner in person . ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white . i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders . the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something . not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable . though i sized up it did n't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull"
__label__1 "i thought this dress was lovely on . i 'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit . it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung . it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful . definitely buying if it makes it to sale ."
__label__0 "that was the only color i liked . it 's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt . back detail is cute but annoying . sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows and the string is at least 3 feet too long . not bad i wear it with white gauze pants looks nice . good with leggings too ."
__label__0 "loved the look of this wool and so well made ! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat . just overwhelmed me and did n't look good . i 'm 5/9 and 160 lbs so i 'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric ."
__label__1 "i read the rave reviews but tried this on with low expectations . i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges . the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down . i am 5 ' 6 135lbs and a small fit perfectly . i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today ."
__label__0 "this shirt is really cute but a little stiff . it does come with a slip but the slip was tight but the shirt fit maybe even a little big . i used another cami under which was better . i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt . i got it in the store with the 30 % off so it was a good deal . it does stretch out as you wear it so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger but still cute on and for a summer shirt it 's thin so it does work well in that r"
__label__-1 "the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it does n't work . ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly . this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__-1 "the color and quality of this sweater are fantastic . the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck did n't seem right to me . it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl . i will be returning the sweater because of that ."
__label__1 "this dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it did n't fit me right . i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust . this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist . i guess i 'm just too busty for this dress . too bad because i really wanted it to work . it is a lovely dress ."
__label__-1 "this top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color . the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes . one side you could see the top of my bra the other side was below the side of my bra . you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole it was that big . this went back will not re-order . i usually order xs or xsp this was an xsp ."
__label__1 "this dress is comfortable hugs and skims at all the right places and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me . wish the other patterns were n't sold out ."
__label__-1 "the sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made . the back is an interesting twist but the material creases easily ; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day . the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large . i got my usual s and i could have sized down 1 maybe even 2 sizes . i did n't like it enough to try a smaller size ."
__label__0 "the colors of this top are perfect for spring i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom . what i did n't like and primary reason i may be returning is the elastic bottom . it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide . i am very disappointed about this as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous ."
__label__0 "unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my . i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ; ) . maybe it works better on somebody more curvy ."
__label__-1 "fabric is not as rich as shown in photo . dress much shorter than shown in photo . shoulder area is tight and really does n't blend with the material below . this is n't going to work on very many people - pear shape ... just not what i 've come to expect from retailer ."
__label__1 "sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly . i am 5 ' 6 and 165lbs just fyi . dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body . it 's very slimming . looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding"
__label__0 "this top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo and i am short at 5 ' 2. cute top but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style ."
__label__-1 "first problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct . the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not . secondly it has a really funky cheap unfinished raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress . the keyhole in the front is super long-again does not seem to fit the dress . i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts . length is just above knee . i am 5 ' 5 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit . sending this home t"
__label__-1 "the fit of the top is true to size but i really do n't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace . the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe . it is terrible paired together . i also did n't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin . even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail i 'm absolutely sending it back ."
__label__1 "this is my new favorite top ! looks and fits as described ."
__label__-1 "i love the idea of this shirt but the execution is absolutely horrible . i ordered online and what i received is just a mess . the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread . not just a few hanging off but literally big clumps . a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside ! ! the fit is just as big a mess . i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br"

__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."
__label__1 "the print caught my eye . then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on . i am only 5 ' 2 '' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well .. this dress fit me perfectly ! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments . this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny ."
__label__-1 "based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering . i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it would n't work . i ca n't imagine this would flatter very many people . the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive . very disappointed -- this will be going back for sure ."
__label__-1 "the turqoise color is pretty however it did smell bad out of the package . i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants bra and cami ! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub ."

__label__0 "i was so excited to get this ! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue . it reminded me of the ocean . however the fit was off . the waist was too high the length too short and the straps to long . i was very disappointed . i considered taking it to the tailor before returning . ultimately i decided to return ."
__label__0 "it 's a very cute design . it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans if can even be dressed up . however i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down . it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has . it 's a very cute design it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn . when it does cooperate i 've gotten many compliments on it ! order a size up i am normally a small but the medium worked be"

__label__-1 "this is another item i 've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available . i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i did n't even try it on because i knew it would be going back . the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric . the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim . so much potential just executed poorly ."

__label__-1 "this would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape . it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy . too bad !"
__label__0 "nice lines just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders ."
__label__1 "these are very cute but very very stiff . have washed 3x and still not relaxing . not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear . my waist is smaller and generally have gap in waist to get fit right in hips . super cute with sandals mules duck boots ."

__label__0 "i tried this on at the store and though it was pretty i was a little underwhelmed . it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up . the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking . the idea of the top was better than the execution ."
__label__-1 "i bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes . it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes . i did n't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat . that part of the coat is really nice and comfy . unfortunately the rest of the coat ( the wool part ) is very itchy . it would 've been awesome if it was lined on the inside but it 's not ... so i 'm taking them back ."
__label__0 "the regular length i tried on in store definitely did n't work for me . for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__-1 "as a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs ! they are amazing for dressing up ( or sassing up ) and outfit . i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them . however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor . after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat ! i really do n't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved . i 'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants !"
__label__1 "gorgeous detail on the sleeve . adorable pattern . unfortunately it is a little too cropped & it 's not actually sleeves . it 's a cape style . was n't expecting but still really cute ."
__label__1 "great rather heavyweight long cardi . i purchased the blue which is a lovely shade of gray/blue not quite as bright as the picture depicts . pin is adorable ; doubt i 'll ever use it to close the sweater but still a nice touch . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 136 lbs 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium . took a medium in this one and glad i did . perfect fit . falls exactly like on the model ."
__label__1 "this is a really nice fitting sweater knit skirt . the knit is soft and comfortable heavy enough to smooth out some bumps but definitely shows your curves . i got medium and it 's a little snug at the waist ( i 'm about 29-1/2 ) but not so much to return it and it fits the rest of me great . the only thing i wish was that they 'd made the slip full length it only goes about mid-thigh and sometimes when i get up the slip stays up while the skirt falls right but not a big negative ."

__label__0 "this sweater has potential but it was n't right for me . the collar is n't flattering on me ... too thick and my shoulders are already broad . my waist is high so i need a longer look . the color is true to size but it 's s little see through ... dark bra shows through ."
__label__0 "this top may be right for some but it did not work for me . i 've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one . however it did n't do much to flatter my body . i ordered the xl but it was huge . i 'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available . i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big . the quality is great and style so pretty though . i wish it had worked for me !"

__label__1 "really cute and very comfortable . material is thin and sheer . i wear tanks under things anyway but especially in pink you would need to . but love the style ."

__label__0 "while i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it ! i mean it was truly laughable ! do n't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board ."

__label__1 "this dress ran large on me . i am a 10 sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me giving me no shape . the colors are pretty and the dress was nice but i expected it to wow me more for the price . sending back may try again if the next size makes it to sale ."
__label__1 "soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large so i will try a medium ."

__label__1 "this is a beautiful skirt . great soft draping fabric . fringed along the edges . i ordered size large which was an okay fit perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist . because i carry my weight in the tummy this made me look wider than i am . as an elder i just could n't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee . i have great legs but my knees are n't their best feature . so sadly returned but i do recommend ."
__label__0 "this was pretty to look at : nice weight lining colors . i tried it on and whoa . ridiculously bad . i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that . the model photo looks great so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips . definitely not for me though ..."
__label__-1 "had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits . however that was not the case . this skirt is not lined and the material is so so . basically for the price i was underwhelmed and will return it ."
__label__1 "this dress stunning for the hourglass figure . the hips may be a little narrow . i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best . i read some reviews that said the hips were snug . it 's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering . shoulders are a little loose and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest . i 'm 5 ' 4 32dd waist 27 and 130 lbs ."
__label__1 "these are very cute and i bought both colors . they are accurately pictured . however right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor . must be the dye . i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them . they seem to be calming down a bit but it 's been two days ! ! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen . dress up or down . i 'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well ."
__label__1 "the color of this dress is sublime . so is the fit . ruching in all the right places . made me feel glamorous . it 's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat vest or cropped jacket . the material feels so nice against the skin too . it 's a must have ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to order this beautiful coat . it does seem well made and is very soft . unfortunately the fit is completely off and is overall large . i ordered a small as this coat appears slightly more snug on top a-line on the bottom with three buttons . i am 5 ' 6 and weigh approximately 145. i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming . instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared . the pleat on the back is unflattering . sadly going back ."
__label__1 "now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done . there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points : great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever ! i got the 10p and my body is 5 ' 3 140 # 36dd"
__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online . so sad to see how this dress fits : just right up top just right along the hem and then it 's a hot potato-sack-frump mess in the middle . it 's a shame because the fabric is beautiful ."
__label__0 "i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom . it is too pricey to live up to my expectations . it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you ca n't see in the pictures . this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap . it is made of viscose and dry clean only . the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion . if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me ."
__label__-1 "it just is n't that flattering on me . it looks kind of old and dingy even though it 's brand new . it fits fine but does n't do much to highlight my curves . it just kind of hangs there . the length is somewhat awkward ( i bought the petite version ) . maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny like the model . it 's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front which reminded me of maternity wear . it does appear to be pretty well made ; top part is lined . overall it 's not terrible"
__label__0 "this top did not look at all like it did on the model . i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose . great for someone who is pregnant . which i am not . returning ."
__label__0 "nice fabric very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust . probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it 's more attention than you may want ."
__label__1 "the only thing i did n't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter but otherwise great ! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit !"
__label__-1 "like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short . i 'm only 5 ' 2 ( xs ) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model . also the quality is n't great as it 's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front . it 's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique . sadly it 's going back !"
__label__1 "this top is such a great color and style . i did have to go a size down as i typically wear a medium . the style is very forgiving . it looks great with shorts and jeans ! it 's staple !"
__label__0 "i found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline ; however the fabric feels cheap and does n't drape as nicely as i 'd hope for the price . this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 5 '' 122 lbs 30dd and took my usual size xs - though i 'm busty for my size the top provides nice coverage ."
__label__-1 "love the shape and flow of this dress . but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back . would not recommend"
__label__1 "this is absolutely beautiful . the picture online does n't do it justice . i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly . fit was a little large . i would have tried a petite but this shirt does n't come in petite sizes . love this !"
__label__-1 "this top is beautiful - even more so in person . however like a previous reviewer the fit is very boxy . there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you ca n't see in the photos due to the model 's cardigan and arms . if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted without all the excess fabric at the bottom it would have been perfect . again the color the lace the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous . would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i ordered an xsmall and a small . i am 5 ' 6 and 110 lbs slender build . the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress . both sizes will have to be returned . possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist !"
__label__1 "i 'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii . it 's a great color soft flowy fun practical ."
__label__0 "i ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived . i ca n't see that in the online photo . i did n't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real . the shirt is very loose fits much like the model photo ( i ordered a small 5 ' 6 140lbs ) . just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily ."
__label__0 "i would give it a 3.5 if half star possible . like other reviews said the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on . overall nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down . i am 5 ' 8 155lbs 36b and m is a little snug for me on the top ."
__label__0 "i recommend with reservations . these leggings are 100 % wool soft not itchy light weight lovely knitted pattern . they run large . i sized down to a small . the first time i wore them they were fine . but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless : they were falling down as i walked . such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days . they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter . so what to do ? at the price th"
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off . they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down . ( i usually wear a 28 or 29 and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs . ) unfortunately the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray . and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion . i will be returning them ."
__label__-1 "the print and front ruffle are beautiful . the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model . it 's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse . such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape ."
__label__-1 "the color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft . but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it . i wanted to love it but it just was n't working for me . i 'm 5 ' 8 and purchased a s. it fits true to size however it was loose around the waist and just was n't complimentary on me . this will have to go back ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! although i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium . i am 5 ' 4 138 pounds and a 34d . the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders . it will work ; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home ."
__label__1 "i adore this dress . i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me . it is so easy to throw on and yet it 's stylish and flattering- i do n't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this . when i bought it it was knotted on one side in the front . that 's the only way i wear it now . it just adds something to it and gives it more shape . i 've washed it several times ( laid flat to dry ) and it has held up well . i 'm definitely bookmarking this to buy"
__label__0 "like the other reviewers i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model . i think she 's wearing a large size and it 's probably cinched in the back . still cute though ! i 'm 5 ' 9 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans ( which i wear anyway ) ."

__label__-1 "i loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd . it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom . for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy ."

__label__1 "beautiful fabric great quality fits true to size . love them !"
__label__1 "i was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand but i 'm a little unsure . the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5 ' 4 frame yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides . i 'm just not sure it hangs right on me . it 's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely and looks great with the front loosely tucked . just not what i was expecting ."
__label__-1 "maternity like and although the back is really cool there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama . returned ."
__label__0 "in the picture it looked to be a structured blazer but when i tired it on ( i got an extra small ) and it was too big ."
__label__1 "i love these but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt but they are still too long . too cute to return though ."
__label__0 "strange fit if you have a short torso . i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange so i tried using a belt and it bunched up . returned the dress . why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work ? !"
__label__1 "i really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings . it does run a little large . i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back . it is so soft and comfortable !"

__label__-1 "i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images . it is very thin as others have said . the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured . it is more similar to a cape or shawl design . if you ; 're looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design this is not it . i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design ."

__label__-1 "the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige . well i 'm blonde with fair skin so i 'm not sure this is going to work . it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual . i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts"
__label__1 "this dress is adorable . it 's very comfortable and so flattering . the only thing is i ca n't understand why it is priced so high . it 's a great dress but i 'm just not convinced it 's the worth the price tag . i 'm going to watch for it to go on sale . fingers crossed !"

__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."
__label__0 "great quality top . i do wish it fit me ... i 'm really long waisted and this top was too short . had to return"
__label__-1 "i absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt if only the cut was n't so odd . the sides of the skirt wing out for a very distracting and unflattering look . the stiff felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse . in that respect the model photos are not at all accurate . it also runs large . i had to go down one full size ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is absolutely cute looking . but that 's just that .... looks . i 'm 5 ' 2 size 6 & wears m to l top . i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing . i liked it . but i did n't like how it fit on the underarm area . it hung very low . so i ordered a petite m. still the same . plus the store the lighting was dark so i did n't realize how see through the shirt was too . had to return it ."
__label__0 "i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee . it 's a lovely pattern and i like the fit ( it 's not clingy ) but it 's a bit see-though . it 's not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt ( unless that 's your thing ) . that said i 'm happy with it because it 's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather . i am very glad i got it on sale though . i would n't have paid full price for it ."

__label__-1 "the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red . the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me . the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return ."

__label__-1 "i was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short . very weird look for a wrap . returned ."
__label__-1 "this dress fit so oddly . i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly . the dress was n't tight at my hips in either size it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out . maybe i was too short ? could n't figure it out . the color and detailing are beautiful though ! a little tight in the bust ."
__label__-1 "i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away . i am disappointed ! ! ! the lace fabric is very stiff . i should have listened to the previous reviewer . i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck . although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress ."
__label__1 "i got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $ 68 for a basic top like this .. but for the sale price they are great ! comfortable lightweight and flattering . the black is a little sheer but nothing a tank underneath ca n't solve . a good buy !"
__label__1 "this cover up has great potential . i love the embroidery . the colors and design are great . however it has a number of loose strings . it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it . the fabric is on the thinner side but it is not see through . the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool . i caught it on sale so i am keeping it ."
__label__-1 "i have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans . my favorites are the cords i got last year similar to these so when i saw this fun pair i had to have them . i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on . they are even more beautiful in person than online . and they are so so small . it was n't like they were a tad snug -- i could n't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole . on the 33. i 've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before . this was an extra-depressing first time"
__label__1 "this shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully . i am 5 ' 7 175 and the medium fits perfectly . i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top . bummer ! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up ."
__label__-1 "this is more of a sleep shirt . the fabric is too thin and see through . a camisole would not look good under it . will be returning it ."
__label__1 "i normally wear a 4 and that technically fit if i did n't plan to sit . i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe . it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress . needless to say i 'll wear it on our next date .."

__label__0 "i wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return even on sale price : ( agree with previous reviews : bodice too tight neckline too high/chokes fabric is rough outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas . too bad ... so sad !"

__label__-1 "i disliked this dress . it did n't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured . i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest . i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time . not recommended for petite women ."

__label__1 "loved it . i have receive so many compliments when i wear this . it fit great ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top but could n't . i am curvy ( 36/27/39 ; 32dd ) and this accentuated my hips ( which is not needed ) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy . i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape ; pleating on front would help chest seem larger . i did love the color and construction lace details 3/4 sleeves ."
__label__1 "this sweater runs large and long in the arms . i am 5 ' 5 and often wear petite in pants but not tops . the medium petite is perfect the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants . the blue color is more of a mint green/blue very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet . great addition ."

__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me . it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however i 'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me . the quality is nice . it is medium in weight . it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft . it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me . i wanted to love it but i only just like it . i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be . it was tts ( i 'm 53 and usually wear a small ) . but the material was horribly scratchy . both the body of the top as well as the sleeves . and the design is n't all that flattering . it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life !"
__label__0 "this would be great on someone with a slim build . it 's very true to size it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look . i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way . note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear ( and spring back with cleaning ) ."
__label__-1 "like the previous review said i was excited to receive this top . i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it ! to my chagrin when i put it on it just fell right down and pooled around my waist . i wish there were smaller sizes to order . sadly this is going back ."

__label__1 "this pants are very comfortable and add a little flare to my typical mom pajama look . i found them true to size ; size small fit my 5 ' 7 135lbs frame . comfortable to sleep and lounge in !"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like these but they just did n't look right on my 5 ' 3 sorta bulky frame . i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe i 'm just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try . the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look ."
__label__1 "great as a beach coverup . i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing ! ca n't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon !"
__label__0 "i order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large . i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed . the colors are more muted than in the pictures a faded blue and orange that i did n't really like . return ."
__label__1 "i finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him . the skirt is a beautiful dark navy super soft knit . very long with a texture pattern . i am 5 ' 9 and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i did n't want to try it on . it works for me because i do n't like skirts to cling to much . even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit . normally id say a medium would probably f"
__label__0 "i am so in love with this skirt but unfortunately it runs at least one size small ... since i am a 16 there is no sizing up . the color quality and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior 's sizing than a regular women 's size . so sad because it will be going back ."
__label__1 "love this top ! ! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it . i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you ! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out . also this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles !"
__label__1 "this coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago and fits the same . it is stunning ! i swear life is way too short to wear only average coats . if you are a parks and recreation fan think back to the treat yo self episode ..... and you 'll know what i mean ! i ca n't say enough wonderful things about this one ."
__label__0 "this is a comfortable sweater dress and the quality of the material seems good . the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland . i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf . i decided to pass ."
__label__0 "if you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips the boat-neck on this wo n't be too wide on you . -- -- -- -- -- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops and went with the m and i have very large biceps . if you 're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms i would recommended sizing down a size . -- -- -- -- -- i have a very long torso and did n't find this to be too short ... but i love jeans with a 10 rise . if you are going to pair this with low or medium ( 8.5 ) rise jeans then yes you will"
__label__-1 "i love my very old pilcro stet jeans . they are the perfect denim weight and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush . not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately . the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs . and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide . it 's a bummer ."
__label__1 "this blouse is so pretty ! i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique . i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist . i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less . the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling . i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints ! ! ! i adore it and feel so good wearing it ! if i could change anything i 'd m"
__label__0 "i love the colors of this top . it does run very large though . when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top not fitted at all . the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric . will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind ."
__label__0 "the sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much . but it 's a cute pattern and style . very comfortable ."
__label__-1 "usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one . i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top . possibly better on smaller chests . the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good . not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs . going back : ("
